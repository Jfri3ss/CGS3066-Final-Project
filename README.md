# CGS3066-Final-Project

This project is a website created for a local restaurant with essential database functions and a small application to add items to the menu. 
Duplicate the MySQL server configuration with your localhost and use the sql/cgsfinal.sql file to create a database and populate 
the initial data. 

The site was written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Twitter Bootstrap 5. The backend languages, PHP and MySql, were used for the database interface and the dynamic updates of the menu page with the menu table.
