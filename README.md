# CGS3066-Final-Project-Write-Up

Once you complete your project, include a short write-up (1-page max) that includes the names of the group members for this project as well as a description of each member’s responsibilities. Zip all of your files in a folder and submit them through Canvas. Make sure to include the PHP code for creating the database, and menu table.

For our final project, I was responsible for creating the foundation of the website. I created a folder containing the HTML files for our website along with any images I found online to implement into our image carousel. After creating these files, I inserted a style section to maintain a cohesive aesthetic for the website as well as making sure each webpage matched in format. After that, I ensured all web pages were linked together fluidly through our navigation menu. I also created the image carousel that is consistent throughout all 3 pages. After creating the layout for our website, I wrote out a short paragraph about our “restaurant” in the home page container. Lastly, I went ahead and created a database and table for our “restaurants” menu page which included the names of dishes offered at our establishment and their prices.

For the final project I was responsible for the hours page of the website. I created a JavaScript script to check the hours of the website and it would display to the user whether the restaurant was open or closed. I inserted this code into the hours.html page and ensured the layout fit the page. Additionally, I worked on the design of the website, which involved the navigation bar set up as well as the layout of the content provided. We all had different inputs in regard the style of the website, but we decided to finalize the layout by using a Bootstrap template.
