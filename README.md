# CGS3066-Final-Project
TERM PROjECT  -  TABLE  3066  
Due Date:  11:59 PM on April 22, 2022  
For your term project, you should create a simple website for a restaurant called Table 3066. This project 
can be done in groups of up to 3 students and the goal is for you to practice all of the topics you have learned 
in this course. 
 
Assignment Description:

Unlike previous assignments, this time you have a lot more freedom in completing this project. Ofcourse 
there are a couple of requirements, but feel free to add any functionality or implement any cool ideas you 
have for the website. These are the requirements that all submissions need to satisfy: 
 
The web site should have at least 3 pages including home, menu and hours pages. 
 
Each page should include these components: 
1. A relatively large (food) image at the top. The image needs to be automatically changed every 5 
seconds. 
2. A navigation menu that includes links to all pages in your website. There should be at least 3 links 
in this section linking to each of the required pages mentioned above. 
3. A content section which will be different for each page. Details for this section can be found in 
the following. 
4. A footer section which shows the copyright notice, address of the restaurant and any other infor- 
mation you would like. 
5. All pages in your website should have the same layout. Specifically, all components mentioned above 
should be identical in all pages except for the content section. 
6. The content section on the home page, should at least include a welcome message as well as a paragraph 
describing the restaurant. Check out the websites for your favorite restaurant to get some ideas. Also 
feel free to add anything you want to the content section of the home page. 
7. The content section on the menu page, should list the menu items in this restaurant.  For this part, you 
need to create a table in a database to store menu item information like food name and price.  Also, 
you need to create a form to insert new items to the menu.  You can put this form on the same menu 
page, or you can put it in a separate page.  Either way, the menu items should be read dynamically 
from the database. 
 
The  content  section  on  the  hours  page  should  include  the  working  hours  of  the  restaurant.  Also, 
based on  the  working  hours  you  mention  in  this  page,  your  page  should  tell  the  visitor  if  the 
restaurant  is  currently open or closed.  For instance, if the restaurant is closed on Sunday mornings 
and a user visits the hours page at 11:00 am on a Sunday, they should see a message telling them that 
the restaurant is  closed. 
 
Grading 
This assignment has a total of 220 points of which, 20 points is a bonus. Basically, if you complete all the 
required components and submit a nice-looking website before the deadline, then you’ll get the full credit 
for this assignment  (200 points) plus  20 bonus points which will be counted  towards your final grade in 
this course. Here is a breakdown of the points for each section of this assignment. 
 
➢  Image Carousel (20 points): This includes the correct positioning of the image on all pages and chang- 
ing the image every 5 seconds. 
3  
➢  Navigation  Menu (20 points):  The  menu should have  at least 3 links to the three pages mentioned 
above. If you add more pages, there should be a link to it here. 
➢  Footer  (10  points):  This  includes  the  section  at  the  bottom  of  the  page  with  address  and  copyright 
information, which should look the same on all pages. 
➢  Home page Content Section (20 points): This is mostly just simple text, but you can put whatever you 
want in here. 
➢  Hours page content section (40 points): For this page, besides showing the working hours and days 
to the user, you need a PHP or javascript script to check if the restaurant is open at the moment and 
show the result to the user. 
➢  Menu table in MYSQL (30 points): You need to store menu items in a table in MYSQL. The table 
needs to store at least 2 fields for each item: name and price. But feel free to add extra information 
about menu items like ingredients or spiciness. You must need to write PHP with MYSQL code to 
create the database, table, then read and write to it. 
➢  Menu page content section (60 points):  This section has two parts. First, you need to show the current 
menu  items  to  the  user.  This  should  be  fetched  from  MYSQL  dynamically.  Second,  you  need  to 
include a small form to add menu items to your database. You must need to write PHP with MYSQL 
code to read and then write to it. 
➢  Overall Organization and design of your Website (20 points): Feel free to design the website as you 
wish. You don’t have to follow the sample provided above.
